# Mobile-Robotics-Projects

This repository contains all the projects done in the [Mobile Robotics and Autonomous Systems](https://cursos.virtual.uniandes.edu.co/isis4826/) module at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia. 

These projects consist in different programs that allow the manipulation of a robot, with different pourposes.

Topics covered in the projects include:
* Spacial Location
* Path finding space representations
* Autonomous search and planning algorithms
* Human-Robot Interactino Techniques
* Multi-robot movility

## Motivation

All the solutions developed were successful and we'd like to share them to the public. They may be useful for anyone interested in robotics, specially those who wants to expand in real applications. Furthermore, whoever wants to learn about projects using the [MobileRobots' Advanced Robot Interface for Applications (ARIA) library](http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/ARIA), and the [Leap Motion Developer Kit](https://developer.leapmotion.com) would find an interest and benefit from this repository.
